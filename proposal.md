Title:
Observability and Resiliency for your Apache thrift service

Abstract:

This talk will discuss techniques to implement observability for Apache thrift services. 
It will focus on logging - structured logging and correlated error logging, adding metrics 
and implementing distributed tracing. We will also touch upon implementing resiliency 
techniques via auto-scaling and chaos engineering. The talk will focus on patterns and be language-agnostic. 
However, code samples will accompany the talk and will be in Python.
